# 2D Java game
A crappy 2D Java sandbox

This is far from an actually playable game. It's more of a template for anyone who wants to make a 2D sandbox.

Yes, I know it's slow to use AWT for a game, this is just an easier way to do it for someone who doesn't want whole engine, but doesn't want to do low level programming either.

If you want to create an engine in Java, you might want to check LWJGL out.
